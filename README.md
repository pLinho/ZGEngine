# ZGEngine impact.ts
This project inspired in [Impact](https://github.com/phoboslab/Impact), a JavaScript game engine, ported to TypeScript.


# Status: Dormant

After porting Impact to TS, I ended up forking it into my (currently closed source) game and making a lot of changes that only make sense for my game. So due to that, I am not actively working on the port found in this repo.
